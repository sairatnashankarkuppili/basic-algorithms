Algorithm -1:

1.Start
2.Input n 
3.Initialize sum = 0
4.Loop from i = 1 to n:
    Add i to sum
5.Print sum
6.Stop

Algorithm - 2:

1.Start
2.Input n 
3.If n < 2, print Not a Prime Number and stop Loop i from 2 to sqrt(n):
                  If n is divisible by i, print Not a Prime Number and stop
4.If no divisors were found, print Prime Number
5.Stop

Algorithm - 3:

1.Start
2.Input three numbers: a, b, c
3.If a > b and a > c, then max = a
4.Else if b > a and b > c, then max = b
5.Else, max = c
6.Print max
7.Stop

Algorithm - 4:

1.Start
2.Input n 
3.Initialize factorial = 1
4.Loop from i = 1 to n:
    Multiply factorial by i
5.Print factorial
6.Stop

Algorithm - 5:

1.Start
2.Input n 
3.If n % 2 == 0, print Even
4.Else, print Odd
5.Stop
